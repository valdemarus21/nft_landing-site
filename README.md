 design layout :
 https://www.figma.com/community/file/1077892229983552963/NFT-Dark-Responsive-Landing-Page-UI-UX-Design-Free-Download
To create this layout, I used this stack : 
* html,
* scss,
* js (swiperJS library for creating responsive carousels) 

This layout is designed for the nft platform. 
The project is already built, it is in the "dist" folder, but to see the full development history you can look at the development folder "src".  
The project build file is in gulpfile.js

Dependencies installation :
```
npm i
```
```
gulp
```
 (the default task will run)

Or simply from the dist folder run index.html in any available code editor.
